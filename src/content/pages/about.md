I'm a full-stack developer with 10+ years of experience architecting and building enterprise-level web applications. My expertise spans the entire development lifecycle—from designing robust backend systems in C# .NET to crafting responsive frontends with React and modern JavaScript frameworks.

I specialize in complex cloud infrastructure, having orchestrated full-scale migrations to Azure, architected CI/CD pipelines with Docker and Jenkins, and optimized high-traffic applications for performance and scalability. Whether I'm diving deep into MS SQL database optimizations, building custom CMS solutions, or implementing modern DevOps practices, I approach every challenge with a focus on clean, maintainable code and thoughtful architecture.

When I'm not pushing commits, you'll find me exploring the trails around Portland, Maine—hiking, biking, swimming, or running through the seasons. I'm also passionate about music, spending time with my guitar and discovering new sounds.
