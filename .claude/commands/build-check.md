Run a full build check on the portfolio site.

1. Run `npm run build` and capture the output
2. Report any errors or warnings
3. If the build succeeds, report the output file count and total size from the `dist/` directory
4. Check for any TypeScript errors by examining the build output
5. Verify all content collection entries are valid by checking for schema validation errors in the output

If errors are found, analyze the error messages and suggest fixes.
